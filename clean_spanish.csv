and to think that they had earned our respect a long time ago now i just see boredom too much freedom has been allowed to them too much subordination to us men for this radical feminist of the west who wants to change everything put a monkey on her and there has to be the monkey making her laugh the more they continue with protests and new movements the more they will be judged by men and the fewer permits and benefits they will have by huevxnxs by feminazis 

and for what what do you want to prove i am a work woman i have a family a husband who helps me and cooperates both at home and with the children so there are good men just think and stay with the right one for you do not choose boors and blame everyone for what you decide

i agree for what is which the most of men are dependent on a woman in the sense of organizaci n no s lo in the home and in the field of labour for the fuck of secretar as jam s even so they can only do one task at the same time it complicates your daily life and in the end if it weren t for what we are the mothers that parimos and grew up having to make as they are less bad that leave children bounced that parents of paper that are believed to men just because they were bred and now 

that no one understands that these women are being used to pressure a system and yes they are being used by men who want to undo that system for the benefit of them not everyone not them 

but let s see let s go on strike so that they see that men need us which seems obvious to me since we all need each other and that if not the world would stop but they say they need that day to men it is that they do not stop making the ridiculous and look as stupid when the feminazis raise their arguments xd

spanish speaks of pablo has l that for telling the truth they imprison him to that pay attention woman you who give life do not blame the man that while you raise him you do not instill the truth of society and the country where he lives until when he realizes that the government does not care about his actions now what the one who leaves doesn t win but the one that is forgotten 

do you really think this helps have you taken some time to think before acting on impulses or emotions do you think that some rapist or sexist would think twice about this before doing harm the world goes on and on in the world we all have it and it affects us all equally you have to show intelligence and with this nonsense they only demonstrate something else 

enough of what you say no yes it seems that there is no more ideal than the eternal complaint of everything and for everything with strikes we are going in the opposite direction it is better to get to work and get rid of traumas and complexes 

what i don t agree with is that they re not going to take classes since as long as there is only one student a topic must be given and then they could miss something important just by following other people and because the people who stayed to work having to cover the obligations of the absent people should give them part of their salary they may have noble ideals but their ideas are poorly stated 

if the world stops as she says if women don t work imagine if men didn t the universe collapses hahahaha

without you women the there is no world but there are also many stop undesirable people who become politicians or bankers thieves murderers traffickers and rapists and so many undesirable people

he is on drugs the brat q starts talking in the report since they are involved with the little word equality we already know what an ignorant progressive thought is idea

tremendous nonsense how they like to waste their time following hollow and useless ideologies for things like that they are not taken seriously even if it seems ironic 

they will lose a day of their life in the end they will still be women who also have to leave invitations and cover their expenses with their own money 

 hours of strike is the same as entering late and leaving early hahahah that s a joke do hours or week and there you throw the system down 

so essential they believe themselves their ego does not let them see that no human being is indispensable to the economic world they are all replaceable

this week is getting out of control this can become catastrophic it is in the revelations of the bible careful 

i am a woman but the issue of feminism and machismo is so angry what else does all that matter what you have to be is a person and it seems that there is little left of that let s worry about making that appeal to the entire human race let s dedicate our time and energy to be better it s the only thing you can do with it to divide instead of to unite 

i don t even have to invent anymore in addition to protesting against capitalism it cannot be more absurd because it cannot incredible

well if they didn t exist we re extinct as if there were no men there is no procreation easy and i m against the lbgi that man with man do not procreate 

yeah yeah yeah a day without gossip criticism and other fairy tales at work 

my english teacher v d is spanish and he said q there are many things q should change their spanish laws and there is a lot of discrimination etc

i find the initiative very interesting but not only to work labor would be simple many positions are not occupied by women but in all the areas that women perform how would a day without women be 

a day without women is equivalent to men gathered telling gossip that they never did

what a great party is going to be put together this is how the herrentag is used in germany 

what a piece of shit the same would happen if the men did it another day the blondes another day the rights another day the q are called juan how they want to divide us

women you yourselves with that feminazi destroyed years of true feminist struggles 

what i like the most about that strike is where it says that the men share that day half of their salary hahahaha 

and i a day without femefalsas that aruinan the real struggle of feminists in the world

get out of the way go on strike little by little spain is filled with moors and so many spaniards who convert to that religion will make them all become simple objects as in the rest of arabia 

hahahahahaha and who is the man in charge of that strike

the feminist only adds to the hatred in the world it is promoting the absolute submission of male gender we can t let that happen 

it s really amazing how much machismo still exists in the world 

well it s okay to take a day on strike but the next day to clean and cook twice as much 

and this is called evolving the struggle is every day to carve out a better world both men and women and whoever feels inferior has a problem with himself

when you start from a good idea of equality and then become a sick radical

bullshit i m a woman i feel that there should be a change in society and at home especially in many mothers who educate weak or macho men and who educate chachas or liberal women this helps who 

they want to change the paradigm they re going on strike it looks like a child s tantrum

no breakfast cleaning washing and ironing no lunch or dinner i want to see parents changing countries cleaning their children s tails after popping etc ah that the babies vomit on them and much more half a day if they survive without destroying everything it would be a feat 

if the strike is silent is it possible to schedule one per week of ac until i die of old age 

then do not complain when you have a letter of dismissal the next day

they themselves are taking away the respect earned by real fighters

extend it until december st no to the feminazis 

every day this topic degenerates more taking it as a pretext to protest for everything and for nothing 

that day all the men are going to go to drink with no one to fuck them bravo 

women s strike perfect and who do they have babies the children who are in intensive therapy as children electrodependientes which have dependent children of a dose of insulin the single mothers who work and they lose the day and presenteeism have children or if they should go to a medical advice in f n 

i m sorry but women can t have so much liberalism and this is not equality who is doing something to them today the individuality that they want the most is respected too much 

jajajajaja only two hours of stoppage it is seen that they can not stand the desire to stay quiet

more than happy would be without us x hs i adhere and we see what they do

if you do not agree put your own company and stop being agitated

cnn assumes that all women are going to participate in that ridiculousness 

nor the exaggeration in any case let s do the same in reverse

i m just wondering do they really ask for equality in everything or only for what interests them 

i would like a day or a thousand days without men macho violent rapists aggressive stalkers murderers ect ect without men the world would breathe peace and flowers would be born and the rain would be a dance until it inspires me i want very few men in my life only one who is my boyfriend and my favorite politician none more

the ridiculousness in its maximum expression

and since it would be a day without men i think it would give the same results 

these are no longer feminists but feminoids

what a bunch of egomaniacal sexists let them darn you 

the typical radicalism that destroys good causes

it would be a silent day

one day is not enough 

the only thing they are going to achieve is accumulation of dishes and dirty clothes

 hours of silence

fucking feminazis

a day without feminazis not a day without women not all of them are subnormal

we have to make it global
